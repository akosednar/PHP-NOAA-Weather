Usage
----------------------------

See example.php

CURRENT CONDITIONS

The full current conditions report is now avilable as current.  Basically current is just a SimpleXML object version of the NOAA XML feed with the addition of the custom_icon field which uses the custom icon mapping.  See example.php for some samples of how to display data from the current conditions.


FORECAST

The forecast feed provided by NOAA is split up into night and day periods, 
with low temps being grouped in the night periods and high temps in the day period.  
Additionally, detailed conditions are provided in a 3rd period which lists both 
days and nights.

get_weather will create an associative array of time periods and the weather values.  It will copy both low and high temps into each day period for simplicity.
E.g.  It will take the "Low" temp for "Wednesday Night" and copy it to "Wednesday"
